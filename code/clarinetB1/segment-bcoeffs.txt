# these are bcoeffs files with spline dimension n=60
# derived from the input clarinetB1.wav at 48000 sample rate
# with fundamental frequency about 57.3 Hz.
# This means about 840 samples per cycle.
# Each segment is 2048 samples, which contains typically at least two cycles.
# The file is about 10 seconds, 227 segments.
# In the first 10 segments 0-9 we select one cycle, based on similarity.
# After that we select one cycle from every fifth segment 10-50.
# 5 segments is about 10K samples, or around 200 milliseconds.
# 1 second is about 23 segments.
# The cycles are quite stable in the first few seconds after attack.
# The first notable deviation is at around 3.4 seconds, segment 73.

# It would be good to have a script that selects key cycles according to
# similarity, using a correlation type function, perhaps as simple as vector
# dot product of bcoeffs for example.  This could be applied in order to arrive
# at the most similar cycle to the previous cycles.  It might also need to have
# an override setting, to choose particular cycles and let the rest be generated
# by the comparison function.
