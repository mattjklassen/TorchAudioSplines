# ----- Brief Description -----
# 
# Generate one cycle as waveform, and return waveform.
# inputs: cycle = [a,b], B-spline coefficients vector = c.
# assume a and b are time values in samples between integer points, so that the
# spline is computed on interval [a,b] and evaluated at M = floor(b)-floor(a) integer 
# points or samples to produce waveform sample values. The waveform will have
# values indexed 0 to M-1 at given sample_rate.
