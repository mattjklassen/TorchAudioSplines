# number of floats in each file determines n = dimension of splines (must all be equal for consistency)

# fundamental frequency of first note:

# number of notes in melody if using regularly spaced notes (use notes = 0 if stat = 1):

# if stat = 1 then stationary points of melodic contour spline are used for melody:

# if invert = 1 then pitches of melody are inverted:

# if retro = 1 then retrograde melody is generated:

# scale y axis of spline, where original values -1 < y < 1 is a span of two octaves, so scale=2 gives 4 octaves:
scale=2

# shift y values by a constant, so shift=1 moves pitches up an octave:
