# key bcoeffs are used to build each tone with cycle interpolation
# key bcoeffs file names must contain "bcoeffs", and contents must be one float per line (as text)
# number of floats in each file determines n = dimension of splines (must all be equal for consistency)

# this can be useful if bcoeffs are the same for all key cycles
# if not specified then gains will be set to 1.0 for all bcoeffs
