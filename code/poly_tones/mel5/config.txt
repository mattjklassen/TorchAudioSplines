# comment lines are ignored but blank lines are important to mark the end of reading a list

# keys are based on length of tone = 1 second, at f0 = 110Hz
# number of keys will be set to num_keys then bcoeffs are read in from that number of files

KEYS:
0.0
20.0
40.0


# key bcoeffs are used to build each tone with cycle interpolation
# key bcoeffs file names must contain "bcoeffs", and contents must be one float per line (as text)
# number of floats in each file determines n = dimension of splines (must all be equal for consistency)

# gains can be used to give an envelope by specifying one float per key cycle.
# this can be useful if bcoeffs are the same for all key cycles
# if not specified then gains will be set to 1.0 for all bcoeffs
# if number of gains is less than number of keys, last value will be repeated

KEY GAINS:
1.0
0.7

# uncomment key-knots.txt to use a special knot sequence for the key bcoeffs files, otherwise default
# knot sequence will be used, which is the usual 0,0,0,0,1/k,2/k,...,(k-1)/k,1,1,1,1 with k = n-3
# with length N+1 = n+4 (n = N - d).

# if retro is 1 then retrograde melody is generated:
