### finish material.py - to generate lots of musical material from one wav file


### finish breaking up findCycles.py into separate functions which we can call in material.py


### generate musical composition from material.  Various interpretations of spline curves include:
pitch sequences, rhythmic sequences, pauses and timing of entrances, dynamic range values.  
The form of the composition could also come from the cycle shape by assigning certain materials
to certain ranges of y-values of the spline. As these re-occur, so would the thematic material.


### continue with splinusoid examples, which can form one thread of material generation
which is a base case of melody from cyle, giving the interval of a neutral sixth, about 848 cents
coming from 2^(2^(1/2)/2) = 2^(2^(-1/2)) = 2^(sin(Pi/4)).  Sound comes from repetition (of cycles)
and music comes from repetition of motives (motif's) and phrases.  Repetition builds familiarity.


### refactor plotBcoeffs.py to take command line args, including knot sequence in file


### adapt material.py to start with bcoeffs for cycles, avoiding the first step of computation
of those bcoeffs from an audio sample.  For example, we could use the splinusoid cycle to generate
tones, and melodies.
